For example: "I love this paper and I think the previous team building strategy behind is worth exploring further" is a general positive text, and the review. and Sentiment Analysis also known as opinion mining refers to the identification, extraction and study of sentiment states by using natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics and biometrics.

### Datasets
In this project, we used one dataset. Let us now describe the datasets in more details:
<p align="left">1. ICLR 2020 Conference | OpenReview dataset using selenium crawler</p>
https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2020/Conference

This set is a collection of paper reviews documents labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarity (positive or negative or neutral). The set collected in 2020-Dec-20 and it contains 702 positive and 794 negative and 1038 neutral processed reviews. The reviews were preprocessed by the dataset editors so that each review is formatted as a plain tokenized text, containing no structured information that can imply on the polarity of the text (e.g., label – 0/1). The average review size (in words) is 40000. Although this set is considered as a user-generated content the language is relatively grammatically correct in most cases, probably because users are not restricted with the size of the text.
